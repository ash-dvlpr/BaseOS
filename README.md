# BaseOS

BaseOS is a small, fast operating system for Anbernic RG XX handhelds. It
handles the hardware and starts your choice of frontend:
[NextUI](https://nextui.loveretro.games), [Slot](https://slot.kowalski.io),
[spruceOS](https://spruceui.github.io), or your own. It has no menu of its own.

**[Installation guide](https://github.com/pvaibhav/BaseOS/wiki/BaseOS-Install-Guide)**

## Startup time

BaseOS takes about **2.2 seconds after Linux starts** to hand over to your
frontend on RG SP. We check this against a **2.50-second** limit. Your frontend
then takes additional time to display its menu.

BaseOS 1.3.0 also measures startup more accurately using the hardware timer and
a clock unaffected by network time corrections. The boot log now separates
**pre-kernel** time (loading the kernel and its earliest startup work) from
**post-kernel** time (the rest of startup up to frontend handoff).

In the latest three RG SP restart tests, the medians were **3.42 seconds
pre-kernel**, **2.17 seconds post-kernel**, and **5.62 seconds combined**. These
measurements end when BaseOS starts the frontend; they are not a power-button
to visible-menu measurement. Times vary with the device and SD card.
See the [measurements](experiments/h700-kernel-gzip/README.md#steady-state-measurements)
and [timing details](docs/09-boot-profiling.md#measuring-startup).

For comparison, v1.2.0 reported **2.25 seconds after kernel start**, versus
about **2.17 seconds** now. Its uncompressed boot path also took longer before
the kernel: earlier RG SP tests measured about **3.72 seconds**, versus
**3.42 seconds** now. That pre-kernel baseline was measured on a later
development build using the old boot path, so it is an approximate comparison.
See the [earlier results](experiments/rgsp-boot-timing/RESULTS.md).

## Features

- Display, sound, controls, Wi-Fi, HDMI, LEDs and deep sleep support.
- A small system with minimal background activity.
- Automatic expansion to use the full SD card on first boot.
- Updates by copying one file to your card. Games, saves and settings stay put.
- SSH/SFTP over Wi-Fi and adb over USB, enabled by default.
- USB storage mode to access your card from a computer.

## Installation and updates

For a fresh install, download your model's `.img.zip`, unzip it and flash the
`.img` to TF1. Flashing erases the card. Follow the
[installation guide](https://github.com/pvaibhav/BaseOS/wiki/BaseOS-Install-Guide)
for first boot and NextUI setup with one or two cards.

To update, copy your model's `.bosupd` to the root of your frontend card and
restart. Keep power connected during the v1.3.0 update: it may show a one-time
“optimising startup” message. Let it finish without switching off.

### Other frontends

Use TF1's visible data partition or a FAT32/exFAT card in TF2. A usable TF2 card
takes priority.

- **Slot:** extract its H700 release and copy the contents of `slot-<version>`
  to the card root, including `System/slot`, `System/mgba_libretro.so` and
  `System/gpsp_libretro.so`. Put games in `Games/` and optional BIOS files in
  `BIOS/`. Update by replacing `System` with the folder from the new release.
- **spruceOS:** copy its extracted H700 release to the card root, including
  `spruce/scripts/runtime.sh`.
- **Your own frontend:** add `System/launch_frontend.sh` or a glibc AArch64
  binary at `System/frontend`. The binary takes priority; scripts run through
  `/bin/sh`. Both run from the card root and need no executable bit.

If several are installed, BaseOS chooses your custom frontend first, then
Slot, NextUI, and spruceOS. Remove higher-priority launchers to select another.
NextUI's pending `MinUI.zip` and `*.pakz` installers run before this selection.

## Settings

Edit `baseos.conf` at the root of TF1's visible partition, then restart.
Settings stay on TF1 even when your frontend is on TF2, and survive OS updates.

```ini
hostname=my-handheld
mdns=true
```

- **`hostname`**: your device's network name. Defaults to its model ID, such as
  `rg34xxsp`. Use 1–63 letters, digits or hyphens, with no hyphen at either end.
- **`mdns`**: connect using `<hostname>.local` over Wi-Fi. Enabled by default;
  set `false` to disable it.
- **`ssh_password`**: set your SSH password. Defaults to `root` if omitted or
  empty. It is stored as plain text on the card, so don't reuse an important
  password. Write it without quotes; surrounding spaces are trimmed.
- **`headphone_pop_fix`**: set `true` to try the headphone exit-pop fix. Off by
  default because it can use more battery while awake. The speaker pop fix is
  always enabled. See [audio support](docs/05-runtime-power-network.md#speaker-and-headphone-pop-repair).

Omitted settings use their defaults. Lines starting with `#` are comments;
`#` within an SSH password is part of the password.

## USB access

For adb, connect a data-capable USB-C cable before powering on. If adb stops
working after unplugging it, restart with the cable connected.

For USB storage, hold **MENU** while connecting the cable. If the handheld
doesn't start automatically, hold Power for 3–4 seconds. Release Power when it
starts, but keep holding MENU until you see **“USB STORAGE: EJECT BEFORE
RESTART”**.

Eject the drive on your computer before restarting the handheld. Restart
without holding MENU to return to normal.

## How it works

BaseOS uses Anbernic's bootloader, kernel and hardware drivers for H700
handhelds, with a minimal BusyBox-based system in place of the stock Ubuntu
userland. Version 1.3.0 stores the kernel in compressed form to reduce loading
work, while keeping the kernel itself unchanged.
