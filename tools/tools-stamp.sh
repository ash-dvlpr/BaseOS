# Print the stamp identifying the in-repo sources that work/tools binaries are
# compiled from.
#
# build-tools.sh writes this to work/tools/.stamp; build-stockmod.sh and
# build-rootfs.sh compare against it. Existence checks alone cannot see a
# source edit, so a stale binary used to ship silently alongside freshly built
# overlay scripts — which is exactly how a pre-pill fbsplash reached a device
# whose boot scripts already spoke the new contract.
#
# Every compiled source in the tree is covered by glob rather than by name, so
# adding a tool needs no change here and cannot be forgotten. Only sources built
# into work/tools belong in these directories; busybox, curl, dropbear and
# sftp-server are pinned upstream releases whose versions live in build-tools.sh,
# and changing one already changes that file.
