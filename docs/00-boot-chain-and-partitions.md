# 00 — Boot chain & partitions (the immutable half)

The vendor bootloader, kernel and initramfs come from each target's prepared
firmware. Preparation normalizes stock layouts to StockMod geometry; image
composition replaces the p2 bootlogo and regenerates GPT metadata. The vendor
executable boot code remains unchanged.

The geometry below is the normalized H700 layout. Target-specific inputs and
preserved-region hashes are recorded in `source.json`.

## 1. GPT / partition layout

The card uses GPT. Preparation accepts full stock and StockMod images, plus
StockMod BASE images with the final `primary` entry omitted. BASE images may
end at p7 without a backup GPT or include a valid full-disk backup. Arbitrary
truncation is rejected. Image composition writes both GPT copies and restores
the `primary` entry when absent.

BaseOS ships **seven** partitions, not the stock eight: `appfs` is dropped and the
region it occupied becomes the unallocated second rootfs slot (see
[07](07-partition-layout-and-updates.md)). Every partition except the user-visible
FAT volume carries GPT attribute bits 62 and 63, to request a single
Windows drive letter. macOS can still expose the vendor FAT volume; see
[desktop visibility](07-partition-layout-and-updates.md#desktop-visibility).

| # | name | start LBA | size (stock) | contents | our image |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | (gap) | 0–73727 | 36 MiB | protective MBR, primary GPT, **boot0 + U-Boot blobs** | verbatim |
| 1 | `special` | 73728 | 64 MiB | vendor special (an almost-empty ext4) | verbatim, hidden |
| 2 | `boot-resource` | 204800 | 32 MiB | **vfat**: `bootlogo.bmp`, `fastbootlogo.bmp`, fonts, DTBs | verbatim except `bootlogo.bmp` ([04](04-boot-splash.md)), hidden |
| 3 | `env` | 270336 | 16 MiB | U-Boot environment (bootargs) | verbatim, hidden |
| 4 | `boot` | 303104 | 64 MiB | **Android boot image**: kernel + vendor initramfs | verbatim, hidden |
| 5 | `rootfs` | **434176 or 1482752** | 7 GiB stock | Ubuntu 22.04 (4.1 GB used) | **the active 512 MiB slot**, hidden |
| — | *(slot B)* | 1482752 or 434176 | — | — | **512 MiB unallocated — the update target** |
| 6 | `UDISK` | 2531328 | 512 MiB stock | stock scratch/swap | **128 MiB ext4 — `/data` persistent state**, hidden |
| 7 | `primary` | 2793472 | rest | vfat ROMs partition | **64 MiB empty FAT32 — grown to fill the card on first boot; the only visible volume** |
| 8 | *(empty)* | — | — | — | — |

`UDISK` and `primary` keep the stock entries' names, type GUIDs and unique GUIDs —
they are *shifted* down one slot, not renamed.

**Boot constraints:**

- U-Boot builds the kernel cmdline's `partitions=` map **from the GPT partition
  names** — verified on hardware: p3 stores `partitions=${partitions}` unexpanded and
  `/proc/cmdline` shows it expanded to exactly the GPT names. `bootcmd` boots the
  partition *named* `boot` via `sunxi_flash`. So the partition **names and order are
  load-bearing**.
- `root=/dev/mmcblk0p5` (from `mmc_root` in the env, which BaseOS never modifies)
  names a partition **number, not an address**. Nothing in boot0, U-Boot or the env
  references p5's start LBA, so partition 5 may live anywhere — which is exactly what
  makes A/B slot switching possible by rewriting the GPT alone.
- Partition **type and unique GUIDs are not known to be load-bearing** (U-Boot matches
  by name), but BaseOS preserves them anyway: they cost nothing and keep the table as
  close to stock as possible. GPT **attribute** bits are BaseOS-set and boot fine.
- `prepare-stock.sh` derives `boot-prefix.img` directly from the selected target's
  normalized firmware layout, ending exactly at p5's start. The known RG40XXV layout makes this
  **222,298,112 bytes**; other targets are read from their GPT rather than assuming
  that value. The source name/hash, geometry, prefix hash and preserved-region hashes
  are recorded in `work/<target>/source.json`. The image starts from this prefix,
  then both GPTs are regenerated for the smaller target size (see
  `tools/mkgpt.py` in [02](02-image-build-and-flash.md)).
- `bootdelay=0` already, so there's no U-Boot key-press window to shave.

### The env partition (p3) cmdline

Read raw from p3 (`dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p3 | strings`), the environment stores a
*template*, not a finished cmdline:

```
mmc_root=/dev/mmcblk0p5
setargs_mmc=setenv bootargs ... root=${mmc_root} rootwait quiet splash
            init=${init} partitions=${partitions} cma=${cma} snum=${snum} ... gpt=1
```

`partitions` is filled in by U-Boot at runtime from the GPT partition names — this is
the mechanism that makes names load-bearing and start LBAs free. On the running
handheld `/proc/cmdline` therefore reads:

```
root=/dev/mmcblk0p5 rootwait quiet splash init=/init
partitions=special@mmcblk0p1:...:rootfs@mmcblk0p5:UDISK@mmcblk0p6:primary@mmcblk0p7
console=ttyS0,115200 loglevel=4 cma=64M ... gpt=1 lcd_type=boe
```

We never modify p3. `quiet` suppresses kernel log spam; to debug boot, one can
temporarily remove it, but the image build never touches p3.

## 2. The hidden vendor initramfs (p4 is an Android boot image)

Partition 4 (`boot`) is an **Android boot image** (`ANDROID!` magic) that
bundles the kernel **and a vendor initramfs**. Extracting it (2 KiB page size; kernel
then gzip'd ramdisk) reveals a small BusyBox-1.22 (2015) initramfs whose `/init`:

1. parses `root=` / `gpt=` / `console=` from `/proc/cmdline`;
2. runs `e2fsck -y` on the root device;
3. **mounts root with `-o rw,noatime,nodiratime,norelatime,noauto_da_alloc,barrier=0,data=ordered`**;
4. `mount --move /dev` and `exec switch_root /mnt /init`.

The root filesystem must satisfy two requirements:

- **The root ext4 MUST have a journal.** The initramfs mounts with `data=ordered`,
  and the kernel *rejects* that on a journal-less filesystem
  (`EXT4-fs: can't mount with data=, fs mounted w/o journal`) — an eternal boot
  splash. So `mke2fs` for p5 must **not** pass `^has_journal`.
- **Our `/init` must be a regular file, not a symlink.** The 2015 `switch_root`
  chokes on our `/init → sbin/init → busybox` symlink chain (stock's single-hop
  symlink works; the exact difference is unproven). We ship `/init` as a real
  script that `exec`s BusyBox init (see [01](01-rootfs-and-init.md)).

The vendor initramfs mounts root **read-write** (not read-only). We do not currently
remount it `ro` — see the read-only-hardening item in [06](06-status-and-lessons.md).

## 3. ext4 feature policy for the 4.9 BSP kernel

The vendor kernel is 4.9.170. Modern `mke2fs` (e2fsprogs 1.47) enables features it
cannot mount. Both of our ext4 partitions — the rootfs slots and `UDISK` — are
created with:

```
-O ^metadata_csum,^metadata_csum_seed,^64bit,^orphan_file
```

The build keeps a journal and disables these optional features for vendor BSP
compatibility. Keep this feature mask aligned with `build-image.sh`; changing
it requires testing the resulting filesystem with the target's vendor kernel.

Kernel config points confirmed from `/proc/config.gz` on the device:

- `CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y` but `CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT` is **not** set → we mount devtmpfs
  ourselves in `rcS`, and bake static `/dev/console` + `/dev/null` nodes as a cover.
- `CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE` is **not** set → no kernel text console on the LCD, so
  use serial output or temporary instrumentation for boot diagnosis.
- exfat, squashfs, overlay, f2fs, loop are **built in** — this 2026 kernel has native
  exfat.

## 4. Kernel modules

BaseOS uses these modules where the device profile supports the hardware.
Display, audio, input, PMIC, suspend and filesystem support come from the
vendor kernel's built-in drivers:

| module | role | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mali_kbase.ko` | Mali-G31 GPU (`/dev/mali0`) | debug data stripped during the build; loaded in the background during `rcS` |
| `8821cs.ko` | RTL8821CS WiFi (SDIO) | WiFi firmware embedded in the module; loaded async |
| `rtl_btlpm.ko` | RTL8821C Bluetooth low-power handshake | loaded during early boot |

Bluetooth controller firmware lives at `/lib/firmware/rtlbt/` (`rtlbt_fw`,
`rtlbt_config`), loaded by `rtk_hciattach -n -s 115200 ttyS1 rtk_h5`.

## 5. Regenerating the GPT for a different image size

`tools/mkgpt.py` reads the primary GPT from the copied `boot-prefix.img`, keeps every
partition's name / type GUID / unique GUID and the p1–p5 start offsets, drops `appfs`
and shifts `UDISK`/`primary` down one entry, reserves the second rootfs slot as
unallocated space, sets the hidden attribute bits, and writes valid primary + backup
GPTs (correct CRCs) plus a protective MBR covering the target size. Conventions (matched exactly by `gptgrow`, [03](03-first-boot-and-expand.md)):
8 entries × 128 B at LBA 2–3, first usable LBA 4, backup entries at `total-3..-2`,
backup header at `total-1`, last usable = `total-4`. See
[hardware coverage](06-status-and-lessons.md) for validation status.
