# 08 — USB adb, mass storage, and H700 OTG

This is the decision record for cable-based USB access on H700 devices. It preserves
the hardware findings and the product trade-offs behind the deliberately small
implementation in `/usr/sbin/usb-gadget-adb`.

## Decision

Enable USB-only adb by default alongside BaseOS's SSH/SFTP service. For reliable adb,
the data cable must be connected before the handheld is powered on. If the cable is
disconnected, restart with it connected. BaseOS does not run a reconnect watcher,
poll the port, force a USB role, or modify the vendor DTB.

Also provide a BaseOS-owned maintenance boot that exposes user storage as writable
USB mass storage. Connect the cable, then hold MENU from power-on. A one-shot state
query selects the mode before frontend storage is mounted. Whole TF2 wins when
present; otherwise TF1 p7 is exported. The frontend is not involved.

On a powered-off device, connecting the cable *is* the power-on, and BaseOS now ends
such a boot by powering off again to charge ([05](05-runtime-power-network.md) §5).
That does **not** pre-empt this entry: MENU-not-held is one of the preconditions of
the auto-power-off, so holding MENU while connecting the cable still reaches storage
mode. Plain adb on a powered-off device does change — press POWER after connecting,
because the cable on its own now powers back off.

This keeps the only USB-C port available for intentional OTG host devices on normal
boots while making the two supported peripheral workflows explicit and predictable.
`/data/no-adb` remains the persistent adb opt-out.

## Verified H700 hardware contract

The RG40XXV uses the vendor Linux 4.9.170 kernel. Its relevant built-in facilities
are:

- configfs USB gadgets and FunctionFS (`CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_F_FS=y`);
- mass-storage configfs support (`CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_MASS_STORAGE=y`);
- UDC `5100000.udc-controller`;
- sunxi OTG manager at `/sys/devices/platform/soc/usbc0`, also exposed through
  `/sys/bus/platform/devices/usbc0`;
- dual-role USB-C wiring with PMU VBUS detection and no useful ID GPIO.

The prepared H700 targets configure the sunxi manager as dual-role OTG. BaseOS
preserves that policy. Investigation also established that the DTB inside Android
boot partition p4 is not the tree Linux receives; the live tree comes from the
checksummed `sunxi-package` beside U-Boot. Neither copy is changed.

The safe runtime rule is to bind the configfs gadget to the always-present UDC and
leave the sunxi manager in auto mode. Its role-control sysfs files must not be used:

- writing `usbc0/otg_role` wedges the writer permanently in uninterruptible D-state;
- `usb_device`, `usb_host`, and `usb_null` are read-trigger controls, not status
  files, and merely reading them can switch or wedge the port;
- reading `otg_role` itself is safe for diagnosis, but BaseOS does not need it for
  normal operation.

With the cable present during power-on, the manager reliably selects peripheral
mode. A later attach can instead select host mode and source VBUS to the computer;
userspace cannot safely override that kernel decision.

## Gadget and daemon

The configfs gadget contains one FunctionFS adb interface (`ff/42/01`) with Google
VID/PID `18d1:4e42`. A pinned, static Android 4.2.2 `adbd` is built with the Debian
and Buildroot non-Android patches plus two local policies:

- stay root, matching the current root/root development-access posture;
- remove the TCP 5555 transport fallback, leaving USB as the only externally
  reachable transport.

The daemon still owns its private smart socket on `127.0.0.1:5037`, so
`usb-gadget-adb` brings up loopback before launching it. FunctionFS cannot bind until
`adbd` has supplied its descriptors, so the script performs one bounded initial UDC
bind loop. That loop handles boot ordering; it is not reconnect machinery.

## Why reconnect is deliberately unsupported

On disconnect or VBUS loss, the vendor manager clears `usb_gadget/g1/UDC`. The
gadget tree, FunctionFS mount, and daemon can survive, and rewriting the UDC name
sometimes re-enumerates after reconnection. A rebinder was implemented and validated,
but it could only repair that narrower case. It could not repair a later attach where
the manager chose host role.

Keeping the rebinder would cost a permanent process and promise recovery that remains
hardware-state-dependent. A polling loop or `/sbin/hotplug` would be worse: an idle
RG40XXV produces battery uevents about every 10.24 seconds. For a shared OTG port, the
smaller and more honest policy is boot-scoped peripheral access:

- cable present before power-on: adb, or MENU-held mass storage — on a device that was
  off, the cable itself is the power-on, so press POWER for an adb session and hold
  MENU for storage mode ([05](05-runtime-power-network.md) §5);
- cable absent before power-on: stock OTG auto behavior remains available;
- cable disconnected from an adb session: restart with it connected.

The only resident USB cost is therefore the already-planned static `adbd` (about
3.4 MiB on disk); there is no USB watcher process.

## Product fit

USB access stays inside BaseOS's hardware and system-service role and remains
frontend-neutral. Setup is backgrounded off the frontend-critical path, has no UI or
network listener, and every wait and failure path is bounded. Missing USB facilities
remain a silent no-op on another target.

Preserving the vendor DTB is also deliberate. Device-only policy would improve
peripheral-mode determinism, but it would remove USB-host support from the handheld's
only port. Requiring a cable-connected boot is the smaller compromise.

## Mass-storage maintenance mode

Hardware probing with a disposable FAT backing file proved that the RG40XXV and
macOS enumerate one composite gadget as both adb and a writable “File-Stor Gadget”
LUN. Root adb remains usable concurrently.

The real frontend volume cannot be shared live: BaseOS normally mounts and executes
the frontend from it, and simultaneous writable access by Linux and a USB host risks
filesystem corruption. Storage mode is therefore an exclusive maintenance boot:

1. connect the USB cable, then hold MENU from power-on;
2. `boot-menu-held` reads the DT-labelled physical GPIO level because the vendor
   driver advertises `BTN_MODE` but does not maintain the evdev current-state bitmap;
3. before mounting frontend storage, choose whole TF2 when present, otherwise TF1 p7;
4. publish only an existing, completely unmounted block device to configfs;
5. keep the frontend stopped while the host owns the device;
6. eject on the host and restart without MENU.

Step 1 survives the charger auto-power-off unchanged. `rcS` tests `boot-menu-held` as
one of the preconditions of that branch — before it unmounts anything or writes the
PMIC — so a cable-caused boot with MENU held selects storage mode, and only a
cable-caused boot *without* MENU held ends itself. This is deliberate: it is the path
a user reaches for precisely when the device is otherwise unusable, and it must not
depend on the device having been on first.

Exporting whole TF2 exposes its real partition table, so the host can access every
filesystem it supports and deliberately repartition or format the removable card.
TF1 remains partition-backed because the running root and `/data` make whole-TF1
export unsafe without a separate RAM-root recovery system.

Every unsafe state fails closed. A missing block device does nothing, and both the
selector and gadget reject a whole device when it or any `pN` child remains mounted.
`/data/no-adb` removes FunctionFS but leaves requested mass storage available.

## Validation

Automated checks cover gadget composition, repeat setup, missing UDC, composite
ADB+storage and storage-only layouts, storage selection, mounted-child rejection, and
the production AArch64 build. `validate-on-device.sh` checks `adbd`, FunctionFS, the
bound UDC, and absence of a TCP 5555 listener.

RG40XXV hardware validation completed:

1. cable-present-at-power-on enumeration and root `adb shell` — passed;
2. 4 MiB push/pull with matching SHA-256 — passed;
3. MENU-held TF1 p7 export, host access on macOS, eject, and normal reboot — passed;
4. unplug/replug recovery is intentionally not part of the supported contract.

Whole-card TF2 selection and safety policy are automated-tested. Real-card acceptance
still needs a backed-up, preferably multi-partition TF2 to verify host enumeration,
write/eject/reboot, and deliberate partition-table operations.
