# Publish the prepared-artifact cache that fetch-prepared.sh restores.
# Usage: ./cache-pack.sh [YYYYMMDD]
#
# Packs every target's boot-prefix.img and stock-harvest.tar — the only two
# things prepare-stock.sh derives from a StockMod .img — into one long-window
# zstd stream, and commits the manifests that make it verifiable:
#
#   manifest/prepared/<target>.json   each target's source.json, the trust anchor
#   manifest/prepared/bundle.sha256   hash of the bundle published below
#   manifest/prepared/bundle.url      where that bundle lives
#
# One stream rather than per-target blobs because the targets share most of
# their bytes (103 MiB of every boot prefix and 2406 of 2409 harvest files are
# identical across the fleet), so a 2 GiB window collapses ~2.9 GB to ~133 MB.
# The cost is that refreshing one target republishes the whole bundle, which is
# the right trade at a couple of firmware refreshes a year.
#
# The bundle hash covers the download; the per-artifact hashes inside each
# source.json cover the contents, and are what every build already checks. The
# bundle is therefore an optimisation, never a source of truth: prepare-stock.sh
# regenerates the same artifacts from the vendor image, and must produce the
# same hashes.

# Host-native: tar and zstd only. Members are passed in a fixed order rather than
# sorted, grouped so each run of near-identical files stays together: all ten boot
# prefixes, then all ten harvests. Interleaving them per target costs ~4 MB.
# --mtime/--owner keep member metadata stable so the same inputs pack to the same
# stream.
#
# 2.87 GiB of input against zstd's largest window (--long=31, 2 GiB) means the
# harvests cannot reach back past the boot prefixes, which costs about 17 MB
# against compressing the two groups as separate streams (133 MB vs 150 MB).
# That is not worth a second stream, a second hash and a second decompress
# pipeline in fetch-prepared.sh for a download developers do once.
