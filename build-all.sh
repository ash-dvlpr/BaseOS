#!/bin/sh
# Build every model's release artifacts from prepared inputs.
# Usage: ./build-all.sh [target ...]
#
# Produces, per target, the two files a release publishes:
#   work/<target>/baseos-<target>-<version>.img.zip   flash once
#   work/<target>/baseos-<target>-<version>.bosupd    every update after that
#
# Inputs come from fetch-prepared.sh (or prepare-stock.sh), so this needs no
# StockMod .img. The shared tools are built once and reused; the per-target work
# is rootfs -> QEMU userspace smoke test -> image -> update payload, which is the
# same sequence build-stockmod.sh runs, minus the preparation step.
#
# The structural gates on the prepared inputs live in verify-target.sh and run at
# prepare or pack time, not here: they check assumptions about vendor firmware,
# which does not change between code builds.
