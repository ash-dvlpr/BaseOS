# Restore the prepared build inputs without needing the StockMod .img files.
# Usage: ./fetch-prepared.sh [--from BUNDLE] [--force] [target ...]
#
# prepare-stock.sh derives exactly three things per target from an 11.7 GB
# vendor image: boot-prefix.img, stock-harvest.tar and source.json. This fetches
# the first two pre-made and installs the third from git, so a clean checkout
# builds every model without downloading ~117 GB of firmware.
#
# It is a cache restore, not a second build path. Integrity is checked twice and
# both anchors live in git: the bundle's SHA-256 (manifest/prepared/bundle.sha256)
# covers the download, and each artifact's own size and SHA-256 — recorded in the
# committed source.json — cover the contents. That second check is the same one
# build-rootfs.sh and build-image.sh already run on every build, so a bad restore
# fails in exactly the place a bad prepare would.
#
# --from takes a local bundle instead of downloading, which is also how you use
# one you packed yourself with cache-pack.sh.
