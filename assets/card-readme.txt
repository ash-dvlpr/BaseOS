Base OS — add a frontend to this card
======================================

This card runs Base OS: a minimal Linux that boots your Allwinner H700
handheld and hands off to a frontend. Base OS itself ships no frontend, so
this data partition is empty and ready for you to add one.

To install NextUI (the current first-class frontend):

  1. Copy NextUI's release files onto the root of this card:
        MinUI.zip
        (and any nextui.*.pakz files from the same release)
  2. Optionally add your Roms / Bios / Saves later — the installer creates
     those folders on first run.
  3. Put the card back in the handheld (TF1 slot) and power on.

Base OS detects MinUI.zip, runs NextUI's installer, and launches it. On every
boot after that it goes straight to NextUI in a few seconds.

To run a different frontend, drop its launch payload here instead; the OS
hand-off contract is documented in the Base OS repo (docs/04, docs/01).

Updating Base OS
----------------

You never need to reflash to move to a new Base OS version. Copy the release's
.bosupd file onto this card and power the handheld on. Base OS installs it to
its spare system slot, checks it, switches over and restarts — about a minute.

Your Roms, Bios, Saves and settings are not touched, and the previous version
stays on the card: if the new one cannot start, Base OS returns to it by
itself. You can leave the .bosupd file here; it is only ever applied once.

This card's whole capacity is available now — Base OS expanded it to fill the
card on first boot.

USB cable access
----------------

adb is available automatically over a data-capable USB-C cable.

To start writable USB-storage mode, hold MENU while powering on and keep it
held until the USB-storage message appears. With a second card inserted, Base
OS exports that complete card; otherwise it exports this card's data volume.
adb remains available at the same time.

Safely eject the disk on the computer, then restart without MENU to return to
normal. Never restart or unplug the cable while the computer is writing.

Base OS settings
----------------

Edit baseos.conf at the root of this card (TF1), then restart normally:

    hostname=MyHandheld
    mdns=true

TF1 always supplies these settings, even when the frontend lives on TF2.
The file stays on the card and survives Base OS updates. The hostname defaults
to the lowercase device model ID, such as rg34xxsp, and mDNS is enabled. Missing
files, missing keys and invalid values use these defaults. Leave the supplied
example lines commented out to keep the defaults.

Hostnames accept 1-63 ASCII letters, digits and hyphens, with no hyphen at
either end. Set mdns=false to disable the Wi-Fi .local name, such as
rg34xxsp.local. Spaces around keys and values, # comments, and Windows line
endings are supported. Unknown keys are ignored.

USB-storage maintenance boots use the defaults until the next normal boot.
